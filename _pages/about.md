I am a research assistant at the [MALL Lab](http://malllabiisc.github.io/){:target="\_blank"}, Indian Institue of Science hosted by [Prof. Partha Talukdar](http://talukdar.net/). I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning on Graphs. My recent research has focused on learning and inference over graphs, knowledge graph completion and representation learning of molecules and materials. Prior to joining IISc, I was a Senior Analyst at the Equities Risk Management team of Goldman Sachs, India. I completed my Bachelor's from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in 2016.
